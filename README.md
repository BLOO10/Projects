# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This is my first project using Python for data analysis.  
I worked on the " Hotel Bookings dataset " and tried some steps like cleaning the data, making visualizations, and basic analysis.  
Itâ€™s mostly for  " practice and learning ", not a professional project.

## Steps I did
- **Data Cleaning**
  - Removed missing values
  - Fixed columns like *agent*, *company*, *country*
- **Visualization**
  - Histograms and heatmaps
  - Boxplot for ADR by hotel type
  - Bar charts for family vs non-family, customer type
  - 3D scatter plot
- **Analysis**
  - Percentage of canceled vs not canceled bookings
  - Percentage of family vs non-family bookings

## Tools I used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly
